# stine-rs
A library for STINE

## TODO
- think about the caches
- The best options is to download the html and then just check if the file is offline avail and parse it.

- longer running functions should perhaps return iterators, for better understanding of the progress idk?

- impl get_content function which returns just the html content
- => then check if the language is correct

## Problems
when parsing and checking submodule id, check if the trailing parameters are also the same, except for -N0, N1, etc..


## Async???
